# Python Virtual Environment Rule

When running any terminal commands in this VoiceTreePoc project:

1. **ALWAYS** activate the virtual environment first using: `source ../.venv/bin/activate`
2. The virtual environment is located at `../.venv/bin/activate` relative to the backend directory
3. The venv contains all required dependencies including langgraph and langchain-core
4. After activation, you should see `(.venv)` in the terminal prompt
5. This applies to ALL python commands, pip installs, and script executions

Example command pattern:
```bash
source ../.venv/bin/activate && python script_name.py
```

Never run Python commands without first activating the virtual environment in this project.

## Project Context

- This is the VoiceTreePoc project with TADA + TROA improvements
- The backend directory contains the main Python code
- Virtual env is at project root: `../.venv/`
- Critical dependencies: langgraph, langchain-core for agentic workflows
- Always test in venv to ensure proper dependency resolution
